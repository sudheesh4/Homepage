              <p> Investigated physics of condensed systems,
              with a focus on active-fluids and light-matter-hybrids (polaritons).
              
              Carried out computational experiments, numerical calculations
              and analytical studies to understand the conceptual conseqeunces of
              introducing complexity of 'broken-parity' (or presence of activity) in fluids.
              Examples of systems with such emergent behaviour include fluids description of bacteria fluids, ferro-fluids etc.
              
              Worked out a design protocol to experimentally create a 'polartion' based quantum-simulator
              for pedagogical condensed matter models.

          <p>My training as a physics student has made me curious and enabled me to learn about understanding various aspects of hydrodynamics,
           dynamical systems, topology and geometry. The interplay of these domains, in problems addressing turbulence,stability analysis,
           qualitative characterisation of dynamics (Hamiltonian physical dynamics) has been the focus of my theoretical work.
           
           More specifically how various fluids (and superfluids) evolve (nonlinearly) at different time & space scales, under
           action of various forces (like gravity, Coriollis, surface tension, odd-viscocity), and the physical consequences
           in the statistics of their associated observables. 
           
           I have also learnt to appreciate the ingenuity 
           of designing analog quantum-simulators, specifically on photonic based platforms like Polaritons.  </p>
          <p>Apart from thinking about condensed matter systems, I enjoy learning about different domains of mathematics, 
          (for instance differential geometry, number theory and knot theory), and exploring various aspects of application and web development
           (specifically python based services).</p>

                     Mesoscale cortical activity refers to the coordination of large groups of neurons, resulting in patterns like
                      traveling waves. 
                      Understanding this collective behavior is important for grasping brain activity's cross-scale integration and cognitive
                      emergence. To address this, they analyzed hippocampal recordings, 
                      finding that activity dynamics become stronger and more nonlinear with increased energy input.
                       Their findings suggest that these dynamics follow weak turbulence principles,
                        indicating stochastic behavior and weak dissipation.They propose weak turbulence as a framework 
                        for mesoscopic hippocampal activity, providing insights into energy exchange and phenomena like theta-gamma coupling.
                        This highlights the ubiqutous-ness of turbulent cascades as mechanisms of optimal cross-scale integration and information transfer in nature.

                 This paper delves into the mathematical underpinnings of Transformer neural network architectures, 
                 particularly focusing on their representation as flow maps on probability measure spaces.
                  It outlines a simplified model capturing key Transformer components like self-attention and layer-normalization, 
                  analyzing their behavior through clustering and posing open research questions. 
                  Additionally, it explores the infinite-width limit of Transformers, discussing their approximation properties and 
                  training dynamics, while proposing a surrogate model for their dynamics on the unit sphere,
                   described as a Wasserstein gradient flow for interaction energy.
                   This perspective suggests that action of a transformer (during inference or training) can be viewed as an abstract mathematical object,
                   formally called vector bundle. These bundles are a central concept in differential geometry and physics.
                   Such parallels are curious and may help uncover the black-box-ness of neural networks.

      This paper introduces a novel model for simulating variable thickness vortex filaments in viscous fluids, 
      offering insights into phenomena like bubble rings and ink chandeliers. By decoupling linear and rotational energy 
      components and considering dissipative drag and buoyancy, the model accurately captures the intricate dynamics of these filaments. 
      Utilizing equations derived from Newtonian dynamics and geodesic motion on a Riemannian manifold, the study elucidates the evolution
       of filament geometry, curvature, and circulation. Through numerical simulations based on the Cauchy formulation of Euler equations,
        the model's efficacy is demonstrated, aligning well with experimental observations. This differential geometry ('bundle' based) approach 
        suggests that the 'behaviour' of vortex rings (specifically their thickness) has similar behaviour as Buurger's equation, which can also be viewed as a general class of interface growth patterns[1].

            A novel robot demonstrates the ability to navigate through water by generating surface waves and interacting with nearby
             boundaries. When generating monochromatic waves, the robot exploits the asymmetry of the wave field caused by reflection 
             from a boundary to propel itself forward. This propulsion mechanism relies on fluctuation-induced forces within the wave field,
              where the distance between the robot and the boundary determines the strength and direction of the force. 
              The interaction between the robot's vibrations and the surrounding fluid produces surface currents, whose magnitude
               varies with the vibration frequency. A simplified force model predicts the robot's motion in response to attraction, 
               offering insights into its dynamics near boundaries. This study suggests the existence of transition dynamics
                between symmetric and asymmetric regimes, indicating potential applications in controlled navigation.    </p>

 Arousal, the state of being awake and alert, is influenced by various factors like the sleep-wake cycle and stress.
  This study explored how arousal impacts brain activity in awake mice. It was found that arousal plays a crucial role in organizing 
  brain function, as it can accurately predict changes in brain dynamics over time. 
  By measuring pupil size or using a single principal component, they were able to reconstruct complex brain activity patterns, 
  suggesting that arousal serves as a key organizing principle for brain function. 
  This framework offers insights into how arousal dynamics synchronize with brain activity, impacting physiological processes 
  across the brain. Furthermore, it suggests a unified approach to interpreting diverse physiological measurements, 
  offering a deeper understanding of the relationship between arousal and brain function. 
  The ingenious use of dynamical systems and encoder-decoder architecture to unify and find a common 'embedding' ground for mutimodal sense-data in organism can be insightful for understading not only human cognition but also possibly inform design of novel neural network architectures.    </p>

By augmenting the dataset with volatility metrics, my aim was to evaluate the efficacy of a random forest classifier in predicting market trends. Volatility serves as a pivotal indicator of a stock's fluctuation magnitude over a specified period. Stocks characterized by high volatility exhibit more pronounced price fluctuations compared to their low-volatility counterparts. Volatility over various periods of time can help us understand the different scales of dynamics a particular stock may be driven by in the market.</p>        <img class='dets_im' src='img/data/volat_log.png'>Volatility over varying periods for a ticker.</img><br><p>Initially, employing only the running trend and close-ratio yielded a precision rate of 58% during backtesting.

This 2% enhancement was achieved with minimal computational overhead, underscoring the efficacy of leveraging volatility metrics in refining predictive modeling strategies and capturing broader correlations.        </p>         <img class='dets_im' src='img/data/rforestcmp.png'>Random forest classifier prediction of stock trend.<br> Left: target;  Middle: just learning trends and ratios;  Right: learning volatility features.</img><br></li>    <li>  <h5>Portfolio optimisation strategies</h5><p>To comprehend the intricacies of portfolio modeling and optimization, I immersed myself in a spectrum of strategies delineated within financial literature. The primary objective of optimization revolved around maximizing Return on Investment (ROI) across diverse time frames, with a particular focus on a 100-day horizon. Utilizing ROI as a pivotal metric offers a robust framework for evaluating the growth potential of individual stocks, thereby furnishing insights into their holistic performance dynamics over time. In the optimization endeavor of a multi-asset portfolio, thorough scrutiny of the covariance matrix (returns matrix) associated with the assets ensued. Harnessing the inverse of the covariance matrix facilitated the execution of a minimum-variance strategy, aimed at mitigating portfolio risk while concurrently enhancing returns. Furthermore, leveraging the eigen-properties of the covariance matrix paved the way for deploying an eigen-strategy, thus augmenting the diversification of the optimization approach. <br>   <img class='dets_im' src='img/data/ROI.png'>&nbsp ROI over 100 days for different stocks. </img><br>Subsequent to rigorous backtesting, these optimization strategies showcased promising outcomes, yielding satisfactory returns. Moreover, during the process, I established a modular Python architecture to implement the procedure systematically, thereby ensuring flexibility for future iterations and the seamless integration of additional strategies with minimal adjustments. <img class='dets_im' src='img/data/portfolio_backtest.png'>&nbspComparison of portfolio optimization strategies.</img>   </li></ul> ";

    <h5>Complex analysis with functions!</h5>
    <p>
    Even simple looking functions can transition into one another so surprisingly!
If you consider a line, then that line is well defined algebraically and unambigously as f(x)=x^1, or one of it's shifted/transformed cousin.
Extending the representation to complex numbers, i.e. letting x take on complex values as well, gives insight as to how curves transform as the expoenent of dependence of f(x) on x changes.
Representing f(x) in such a way is not an issue, as f(x)=x^1 is well defined on all realnumbers.
So moving x in a complex circle just leads to an expanded circular motion of the behaviour of f(x).
However, when we consider f(x)=x^2, which is also well-defined on all realnumbers, we see a cusp forms in f(x)'s behaviour. This is can be understood by recalling the periodicity of complex numbers in their arguments.
Interesting 'non-analyticity' of sorts in f(x)'s behaviour emerges when the expoenent is not integer, in such cases the f(x) maybe well-defined in positive Real axis but may have complex behaviour in the negative real part. As a consequence of this, the circular behaviour of x in complex plane may give rise to changing of branch of the function and not returning back to the original point.

    <h5>N-Torus?</h5>
    
    <p>
    The geometrical and algebraic representation of circle is pretty well known.
x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0
All others are translated and transformed cousins of this same circle.
However other shapes aren't so well known.
I thought I can easily give rise to geometrical representation of circle shape using the implicit algebraic knowledge i have, which should be generalisable to other shapes. I didn't want to use any reparameterisation of coordinates, and just wanted to use the plain old cartesian representation.
	Circle:
		Implicit equation: F(x,y)-r=0 ==> x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0
	Torus:
		Implicit equation: G(x,y,z)-r=0 ==>  ?

And I found a way on the great-internet to generate an implicit euqation for n-torus in a systematic way!
An example:
		G(x,y,z)-r= z^2 + (x(x-2)(x-1)^2+y^2)^2 -r=0

The recipe suggests considering a polynomial of x  such that
		p(x)=x(x-1)^2 (x-2)^2 .... (x-n+1)^2 (x-n)
then the level-set of the following function would give n-torus
		G(x,y,z)= [p(x) + y^2]^2 + z^2 -r=0
where introduction of the third dimension is facilitated through an 'inflation' step of using an appropriate regulator 'r'.

    <h5>Integrability in dyamical systems</h5>
    
    <p>
    

Integrability of a system is a cruical concept in classical physics and dynamical systems. In a very broad way it tries to capture the complexity of dynamics in the system. Integrable systems are simple in that there may be description that significantly simplify the geometrical repreentation of the dyncamics. Integrable systems have a neat correspondance between their dynamic degrees-of-freedom and the aspects of system that remain invariant/conserved. 
Typically the geometricalspace in which integrability is characterised is the construction of phase-space, which is just the collection of all possible dynamical states of a system, endowed with additional metric and structures. When the system changes it basically tranverses this phase-space. Moreover, in this space integrable systems have simple shapes describing the dynamics of system. However, breaking integrability leads to interesting shapes to emerge. Different systems can have different phase-space potraits depending on various factors in the systems. With the breaking of integrability, emergence of stochastic regions also takes place in the phase space. 
</p>
<br>
<img src='img/math/integr2.png' class='dets_im'> Quasi-integrable phase structure in a classical dynamical map.</img>
<br>
<p>
An example of Henon-Hales system has been shown, where initally the integrability is lightly broken, so there are non trivial shapes in the phase-potrait, but the more it gets broken the more these regions are lost to stochastic regions. This happens because the quasi-steady regions which emerge act like dynamical attractirs in phase-space, and they lose stability as non-integrability sets in.

    <h5>Complexity of dynamical attractors: Time-delayed embedding</h5>
    <p>
In dynamical systems Lorenz-attractor is a famous pedagogical example of complex dynamics. It refers to a geometrical 3-d shape which resembles a butterfly's wings. It was uncovered when Lorenz investigated the dynamics of Earth's atmosphere. The associated dynamical system meaning behind it can be understood as 3 seperate degrees-of-freedoms of a system changing in a way that the tupple of their values remain on this shape, or close to it. So if we start with a system-state thats close to it but not on the shape, it'll get attracted to it and stay on the shape. These attractors carry the interdepence of the three seperate scalar variables. However, under some conditions, it is possible to reconstruct the topology of such a complex-attractor using just one of the scalar data. Such a method is called time-delay embedding.
</p><br><img src='img/math/lorenz.png' class='dets_im'> Lorenz attractor </img><br>An example has been shown where using just X and it's time-delayed version we can reconstruct the topolgical shape of attractor X is complexy-ly tied to in (X,Y,Z) shape.

    <p>    Quantum computation is widely finding new theoretical usecases.     Quantum circuits have also been investigated to serve as archetectures for ML applications.     To understand how that idea might be worked out, i tried to make a binary-classifer for iris dataset using quantum-circuit. The idea was to use a quantum circuit, encode input iris parameters as      qubit-state, and then apply the circuit on it to produce a binary classifcation result.     The circuit consists of various rotations-gates, whose parameters are then classically      learnt through training using a loss-optimiser. I was able to get 78% in binary classifcation       with this procedure, which is not very ground-breaking, but serves as a proof-of-concept of potential  intersection of ML and Quatnum-computing.</p>    <br>    <img src='img/math/qcmp.png'  class='dets_im'></li>

    Abelian sandpile model is a prototypical example of self-organised-criticality in complex systems. 
Sef-organised-criticality is the idead that in large complex systems, the dynamics can be attracted to a critical state where in a large scale spatial and temporal orchestrated 'coordination' of sorts emerges.
Sandpile a typical example of such a model, where we drop sand particle by particle on a grid with rules for sand to spill over onto neighbours on grid. This leads to interesting patterns as sand keeps falling. Coordinated avalanches a can be observed.

    <h4>Nonlinear entanglement and tunneling dynamics in quantum kicked top</h4>
    <p>
  The kicked top model stands as a fundamental tool for probing unresolved quantum mechanical phenomena vis-à-vis classical formulations. 
  In its classical rendition, this model unveils a rich tapestry of dynamics, encompassing regular, bifurcated, mixed, and chaotic behaviors. 
  Our investigation, prompted by prior research[1], delves into the deep quantum realm, where correlations between the classical phase space structure and entanglement dynamics have been scrutinized. Notably, we unveil a striking symmetry connection between the variations in entanglement and classical dynamics, particularly delineating the boundaries of high and low entanglement regions in phase space. Focusing on the entangling quantum kicked top, we narrow our gaze to the few qubit scenario, exploring the nuanced interplay between entanglement and spin-coherent states' initial conditions. Our analysis extends prior findings on tunneling behavior, establishing a clear nexus between entanglement dynamics and tunneling phenomena. Moreover, we elucidate the relationship between classical phase space structures and the initial condition dependence of entanglement oscillations, even in the quantum domain of a few spin-1/2 qubits. Additionally, we delve into the correlations between spectral features and these non-classical dynamics, shedding light on the intricate fabric of quantum entanglement.

    <h4>Generation of coherence in an exactly solvable nonlinear nanomechanical system</h4>
    <p>
This research investigated the quantum dynamics of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center interacting with a nonlinear, periodically driven mechanical oscillator. The mechanical oscillation, influenced by continuous periodic driving contingent upon the oscillator's position, was mathematically described using Mathieu elliptic functions. This framework enabled the analysis of quantum spin dynamics, incorporating environmental factors, and assessing the purity and von Neumann entropy of the NV-spin system. The study addressed the unitary generation of coherence, observing that coherence production via unitary transformation differed based on the system's initial state. Efficiency in coherence production was noted when the system began in the separatrix region, associated with classical dynamical chaos. Leveraging insights from chaos theory, it was demonstrated that quantum chaos and the loss of information about the initial mixed state favored quantum coherence generation. Introducing a quantum distance metric from the homoclinic tangle, it was established that for initial states conducive to efficient coherence generation, this distance was minimized.   </p>

    <h4>Modulation instability in parity broken matter</h4>
    <p>
The phenomenon of Modulation Instability (MI) is pervasive in nature, appearing in various systems such as water waves and lasers, 
albeit under different names. In this study, we delved into the interaction between MI and parity breaking, particularly odd-viscosity effects,
 within a hydrodynamic framework of surface gravity waves. By employing a power counting scheme and utilizing derivative expansion techniques, 
 we derived a generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) incorporating odd-viscosity-dependent stability criteria
  for amplitude modulation. Our analysis revealed that parity breaking induced asymmetric dispersion,
   leading to distinct stability criteria for left and right moving modes of the NLSE. We examined the growth rate dependence on 
   odd-viscosity and tried to contrast its impact with that of surface tension. We also explored the feasibility 
   of realizing a non-reciprocal optical platform based on the parity odd generalized NLSE derived in the context of surface gravity waves.

           <p>
     The concept of turbulent wave cascades is fundamental in elucidating the intricate dynamics of turbulent flows and their possible correlation 
   with or deviation from thermalization. 
   Turbulent wave cascades entail the transfer of energy from large-scale eddies to small-scale eddies within a turbulent flow. 
   This phenomenon occurs through both inverse and direct cascades. 
   In an inverse cascade, energy moves from smaller-scale eddies to larger ones, resulting in an accumulation of energy at larger scales 
   and a redistribution towards lower wavenumbers. Conversely, in a direct cascade, energy transfers from larger-scale eddies to smaller ones, 
   leading to energy dissipation at smaller scales.
    Understanding turbulent wave cascades is pivotal across various domains, including fluid dynamics, atmospheric science, and oceanography. 
    By examining the mechanisms governing wave cascades, it gives insights into energy transfer and dissipation processes in turbulent flows, 
    thus enhancing the accuracy of numerical models and predictive capabilities in turbulent systems.
    We are investigating how cascades get deformed in parity broken wave systems.
