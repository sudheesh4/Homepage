          A curious mind trying to blend the elegance of physics with the precision of programming. 
          As a doctoral student in physics with a knack for software-development, I navigate the realms of mathematics, software engineering and AI with inquisitive fascination.
          With experience in front-end development, Python applications, mathematical modeling, and data science, I bring a unique mix of analytical prowess and creative flair to every project.
          My interdisciplinary sensibilities keep my motivations driven and curiosity humble.

              <p> Investigated physics of condensed systems,
              with a focus on active-fluids and light-matter-hybrids (polaritons).
              
              Carried out computational experiments, numerical calculations
              and analytical studies to understand the conceptual conseqeunces of
              introducing complexity of 'broken-parity' (or presence of activity) in fluids.
              Examples of systems with such emergent behaviour include fluids description of bacteria fluids, ferro-fluids etc.
              
              Worked out a design protocol to experimentally create a 'polartion' based quantum-simulator
              for pedagogical condensed matter models.

Leveraging a publicly available dataset sourced from a supermarket, I conducted an analytical investigation to discern transactional trends, specifically focusing on sales and profit dynamics within the company's operations.

This endeavor involved examining the volatility of stocks across varying timeframes, ranging from 2 days to 1000 days.

    <h5>Complex analysis with functions!</h5>
    <p>
    Even simple looking functions can transition into one another so surprisingly!
If you consider a line, then that line is well defined algebraically and unambigously as f(x)=x^1, or one of it's shifted/transformed cousin.
Extending the representation to complex numbers, i.e. letting x take on complex values as well, gives insight as to how curves transform as the expoenent of dependence of f(x) on x changes.
Representing f(x) in such a way is not an issue, as f(x)=x^1 is well defined on all realnumbers.
So moving x in a complex circle just leads to an expanded circular motion of the behaviour of f(x).
However, when we consider f(x)=x^2, which is also well-defined on all realnumbers, we see a cusp forms in f(x)'s behaviour. This is can be understood by recalling the periodicity of complex numbers in their arguments.
Interesting 'non-analyticity' of sorts in f(x)'s behaviour emerges when the expoenent is not integer, in such cases the f(x) maybe well-defined in positive Real axis but may have complex behaviour in the negative real part. As a consequence of this, the circular behaviour of x in complex plane may give rise to changing of branch of the function and not returning back to the original point.

    <h5>N-Torus?</h5>
    
    <p>
    The geometrical and algebraic representation of circle is pretty well known.
x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0
All others are translated and transformed cousins of this same circle.
However other shapes aren't so well known.
I thought I can easily give rise to geometrical representation of circle shape using the implicit algebraic knowledge i have, which should be generalisable to other shapes. I didn't want to use any reparameterisation of coordinates, and just wanted to use the plain old cartesian representation.
	Circle:
		Implicit equation: F(x,y)-r=0 ==> x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0
	Torus:
		Implicit equation: G(x,y,z)-r=0 ==>  ?

And I found a way on the great-internet to generate an implicit euqation for n-torus in a systematic way!
An example:
		G(x,y,z)-r= z^2 + (x(x-2)(x-1)^2+y^2)^2 -r=0

The recipe suggests considering a polynomial of x  such that
		p(x)=x(x-1)^2 (x-2)^2 .... (x-n+1)^2 (x-n)
then the level-set of the following function would give n-torus
		G(x,y,z)= [p(x) + y^2]^2 + z^2 -r=0
where introduction of the third dimension is facilitated through an 'inflation' step of using an appropriate regulator 'r'.

    <h5>Integrability in dyamical systems</h5>
    
    <p>
    

Integrability of a system is a cruical concept in classical physics and dynamical systems. In a very broad way it tries to capture the complexity of dynamics in the system. Integrable systems are simple in that there may be description that significantly simplify the geometrical repreentation of the dyncamics. Integrable systems have a neat correspondance between their dynamic degrees-of-freedom and the aspects of system that remain invariant/conserved. 
Typically the geometricalspace in which integrability is characterised is the construction of phase-space, which is just the collection of all possible dynamical states of a system, endowed with additional metric and structures. When the system changes it basically tranverses this phase-space. Moreover, in this space integrable systems have simple shapes describing the dynamics of system. However, breaking integrability leads to interesting shapes to emerge. Different systems can have different phase-space potraits depending on various factors in the systems. With the breaking of integrability, emergence of stochastic regions also takes place in the phase space. 
</p>
<br>
<img src='img/math/integr2.png' class='dets_im'> Integrable phase structure in a classical dynamical map.</img>
<br>
<p>
An example of Henon-Hales system has been shown, where initally the integrability is lightly broken, so there are non trivial shapes in the phase-potrait, but the more it gets broken the more these regions are lost to stochastic regions. This happens because the quasi-steady regions which emerge act like dynamical attractirs in phase-space, and they lose stability as non-integrability sets in.

    <h5>Complexity of dynamical attractors: Time-delayed embedding</h5>
    <p>
In dynamical systems Lorenz-attractor is a famous pedagogical example of complex dynamics. It refers to a geometrical 3-d shape which resembles a butterfly's wings. It was uncovered when Lorenz investigated the dynamics of Earth's atmosphere. The associated dynamical system meaning behind it can be understood as 3 seperate degrees-of-freedoms of a system changing in a way that the tupple of their values remain on this shape, or close to it. So if we start with a system-state thats close to it but not on the shape, it'll get attracted to it and stay on the shape. These attractors carry the interdepence of the three seperate scalar variables. However, under some conditions, it is possible to reconstruct the topology of such a complex-attractor using just one of the scalar data. Such a method is called time-delay embedding.
</p><br><img src='img/math/lorenz.png' class='dets_im'> Lorenz attractor </img><br>An example has been shown where using just X and it's time-delayed version we can reconstruct the topolgical shape of attractor X is complexy-ly tied to in (X,Y,Z) shape.

    </li>    <li><h5> Quantum Machine-Learning: Binary classifaction</h5>
    <p>    Quantum computation is widely finding new theoretical usecases.     Quantum circuits have also been investigated to serve as archetectures for ML applications.     To understand how that idea might be worked out, i tried to make a binary-classifer for iris dataset using quantum-circuit. The idea was to use a quantum circuit, encode input iris parameters as      qubit-state, and then apply the circuit on it to produce a binary classifcation result.     The circuit consists of various rotations-gates, whose parameters are then classically      learnt through training using a loss-optimiser. I was able to get 78% in binary classifcation       with this procedure, which is not very ground-breaking, but serves as a proof-of-concept of potential  intersection of ML and Quatnum-computing.</p>    <br>    <img src='img/math/qcmp.png'  class='dets_im'></li>

    <h5>Self-organise criticality in sandpiles</h5>
    
    <p>
    Abelian sandpile model is a prototypical example of self-organised-criticality in complex systems. 
Sef-organised-criticality is the idead that in large complex systems, the dynamics can be attracted to a critical state where in a large scale spatial and temporal orchestrated 'coordination' of sorts emerges.
Sandpile a typical example of such a model, where we drop sand particle by particle on a grid with rules for sand to spill over onto neighbours on grid. This leads to interesting patterns as sand keeps falling. Coordinated avalanches a can be observed.
